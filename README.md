## 🧠 About The Project

**CodeWhispererAI** is a sleek and simple AI assistant made using GPT via OpenRouter API.  
It’s built for learners, students, and developers who need real-time help with code, logic, or programming concepts — without distractions or bloated UI.

This is not a full-blown IDE assistant, but rather a clean space to ask, learn, and move on quickly.
